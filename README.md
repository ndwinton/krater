# krater - a ray-tracer in Kotlin

This is an implementation of the ray-tracer from Jamis Buck's
book [The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/).
It might actually be finished one day.

I'm using it to experiment with and learn more about [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
and the [Kotest Framework](http://kotest.io/).
I do not claim that it is a great example of idiomatic Kotlin, good
functional or object-oriented design, efficient coding or anything
else. But if you find it interesting or (somehow!) useful, then
I'm glad.
